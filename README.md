## Vector Generation of an Explicitly-defined Multidimensional Semantic Space

Measures of Semantic Relatedness (MSRs) are a recent breed of computational models of text comprehension. MSRs have been successfully used to model human web browsing behavior (Pirolli & Fu, 2003), language acquisition (Landauer & Dumais, 1997), and text comprehension (Lemaire, Denhiere, Bellissens, & Jhean- Iarose, 2006), among other things. MSRs have also been used in the applied domain for augmented search engine technology (Dumais, 2003), ETS essay grading (Landauer & Dumais, 1997), and many other applications.

## A Proxy For All Your Semantic Needs

Measures of Semantic Relatedness (MSRs) are computational means for assessing the relative meaning of terms. More specifically, MSRs take the form of computer programs that can extract relatedness between any two terms based on large text corpora. Among the many contributions of MSRs are cognitive modeling applications (e.g. Pirolli & Fu, 2003), augmented search engine technology (e.g. Dumais, 2003), and essay grading algorithms used by ETS (e.g. Landauer & Dumais, 1997). Here we introduce an ongoing effort to centralize and unify MSR technology â€“ a publicly available MSR Web Server

## Be Wary of What Your Computer Reads: The Effects of Corpus Selection on Measuring Semantic Relatedness

[PDF](https://github.com/lyoshenka/papers/raw/master/LindVeksGrintGray07_ICCM-libre.pdf)

Measures of Semantic Relatedness (MSRs) provide models of human semantic associations and, as such, have been applied to predict human text comprehension (Lemaire, Denhiere, Bellissens, & Jhean-Iarose, 2006). In addition, MSRs form key components in more integrated cognitive modeling such as models that perform information search on the World Wide Web (WWW) (Pirolli, 2005). However, the effectiveness of an MSR depends on the algorithm it uses as well as the text corpus on which it is trained. In this paper, we examine the impact of corpus selection on the performance of two popular MSRs, Pointwise Mutual Information and Normalised Google Distance. We tested these measures with corpora derived from the WWW, books, news articles, emails, web-forums, and encyclopedia. Results indicate that for the tested MSRs, the traditionally employed books and WWW-based corpora are less than optimal, and that using a corpus based on the New York Times news articles best predicts human behavior.
